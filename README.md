# GAIT-Analysis

This repository is to serve the purpose of GAIT Analysis project (Human Activity
Recognition) under the subject Safety Critical Systems at Frankfurt University
of Applied Sciences in High Integrity Systems (SOSE24).

## Abstract

Gait Analysis is a systematic study of animal locomotion, more specifically the
study of human motion, using the eye, brain, heart movement and function of
observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body
mechanics, and the activity of the muscles. Gait analysis involves measurement,
where measurable parameters are introduced and Analyze, and interpretation,
where conclusions about the subject are drawn.

With the help of Gait Analysis data (which is static in our case) we are
simulating the monitoring of persons walking and running movements in the wave
forms. While monitoring these wave forms, we are calculating the patient’s heart
rate in real time. At the same time, we have set an alert system that shows an
alert when a patient’s condition is critical.
